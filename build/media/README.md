This folder contains all your portfolio media files including certificates, images, and other documents.

## 📁 Folder Structure

```

```

## 🎓 Certificates Folder

Place all your certificate PDFs in the `certificates/` folder with these exact filenames:

### Required Certificate Files:
- `java-dsa-certificate.pdf` - Data Structures and Algorithms in Java (NPTEL)
- `python-certificate.pdf` - The Joy of Computing with Python (NPTEL)
- `solutions-architecture-certificate.pdf` - Solutions Architecture Job Simulation
- `software-engineering-certificate.pdf` - Software Engineering Job Simulation
- `android-developer-certificate.pdf` - Android Developer Virtual Internship
- `hackathon-certificate.pdf` - HackIndia Spark 3 Hackathon
- `ctf-competition-certificate.pdf` - Technix 2025 CTF Competition

## 📸 Images Folder

Use the `images/` folder for:
- Profile photos
- Project screenshots
- Event photos
- Any other portfolio images

## 🚀 How to Upload

1. **For PDFs**: Save your certificates as PDF files with the exact names listed above
2. **For Images**: Save as JPG, PNG, or WebP format
3. **File Size**: Keep files under 5MB for optimal loading
4. **Quality**: Use high-quality scans for certificates

## 🔗 How It Works

The certificates in your portfolio now link directly to these files:
- Clicking "View Certificate" opens the PDF in a new tab
- All links use relative paths like `/media/certificates/filename.pdf`
- Files are served from the public folder for easy access

## 📝 Adding New Certificates

When you get new certificates:
1. Add the PDF to the `certificates/` folder
2. Update the Certificates.js file with the new entry
3. Use the same naming convention: `new-certificate-name.pdf`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Keep certificate filenames lowercase with hyphens
- Ensure PDFs are readable and properly scanned
- Test all links after uploading files
- Backup your original certificates elsewhere

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. Create the folder structure above
2. Upload your existing certificates with the exact filenames
3. Test the "View Certificate" links on your website
4. Add any new certificates following the same pattern

Your portfolio will now have professional certificate viewing capabilities! 🎉
